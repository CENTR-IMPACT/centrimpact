\title{Calculate dynamic discount for network topology}
\usage{
calculate_dynamic_discount_topology(
  layer,
  graph,
  alpha = 0.8,
  beta = 0.5,
  gamma = 0.3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{layer}{Integer. The layer number in the network cascade (1 to n).}

\item{graph}{An igraph object. The network graph to analyze.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Base decay rate (0-1). Higher values mean faster decay with layer depth.}

\item{beta}{Numeric. Density adjustment factor (0-1). Higher values increase the penalty for dense networks.}

\item{gamma}{Numeric. Clustering adjustment factor (0-1). Higher values increase the penalty for clustered networks.}
}
\value{
A numeric value in [0,1] representing the calculated discount factor.
}
\description{
The discount factor is calculated using the formula:
\deqn{\text{discount} = \alpha^L \times (1 - \beta \times D) \times (1 - \gamma \times C)}
where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{L} is the layer number (1 to n)
\item \eqn{D} is the network density (0 to 1)
\item \eqn{C} is the global clustering coefficient (0 to 1)
\item \eqn{\alpha} is the base decay rate (default: 0.8)
\item \eqn{\beta} is the density adjustment factor (default: 0.5)
\item \eqn{\gamma} is the clustering adjustment factor (default: 0.3)
}

The discount factor decreases with:
\itemize{
\item Increasing layer depth (exponentially, controlled by \code{alpha})
\item Higher network density (linearly, controlled by \code{beta})
\item Higher clustering coefficient (linearly, controlled by \code{gamma})
}
}
\details{
Implements a dynamic discounting mechanism that adjusts influence measures based on
network topology characteristics including layer depth, density, and clustering.
