\title{Calculate the Gini-Simpson diversity index (balance score)}
\usage{
calculate_gini(category_values)
}
\arguments{
\item{category_values}{Numeric vector. Values to calculate diversity for.}
}
\value{
Character. Formatted balance score as a string with 2 decimal places.
}
\description{
The Gini-Simpson index measures the diversity of values in a distribution.
It is calculated as 1 - Gini coefficient, where higher values indicate
more balanced (less concentrated) distributions. In the CEnTR-IMPACT framework,
higher balance scores indicate more equitable development across domains.
}
\details{
The function:
\enumerate{
\item Calculates the Gini coefficient using \code{DescTools::Gini()}
\item Subtracts from 1 to get the Simpson diversity index
\item Formats to 2 decimal places as a character string
}

The Gini coefficient measures inequality (0 = perfect equality, 1 = maximum inequality).
By subtracting from 1, we get a "balance" measure where:
\itemize{
\item 0 = completely unbalanced (all values concentrated in one category)
\item 1 = perfectly balanced (all categories have equal values)
}
}
\examples{
# Perfectly balanced distribution
balanced <- c(25, 25, 25, 25)
calculate_gini(balanced)  # Returns "1.00"

# Unbalanced distribution
unbalanced <- c(90, 5, 3, 2)
calculate_gini(unbalanced)  # Returns a lower value (e.g., "0.38")
